### A little try 
I tried to create a link list that is good for any type in `page79_Mine_AnyType.c`.
But kind of fail, 
#### here's the problem:
1. In my final version, I need to change the input port, output port and the malloc statement to adapt the different type. **I think it's not enough for abstraction**.
2. the while(1) thing in main should be abstract to a function, but I didn't continue.
#### comments
1. It took me 260mins to finish! What a loser! I can not even find the bug! Altough i have been really focused.
2. gdb stil better
