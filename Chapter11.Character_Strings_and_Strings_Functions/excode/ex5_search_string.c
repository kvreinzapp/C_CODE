/*
Design and test a function that
1 searches the string specified by the first function parameter for the first occurrence
    of a character specified by the second function parameter.
2 Have the function return a pointer to the character if successful, and a null if the
    character is not found in the string.
(This duplicates the way that the library strchr()  function works.)
3 Test the function in a complete program that uses a loop to provide input values for feeding to the function.
