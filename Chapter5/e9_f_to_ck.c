/*Write a program that requests the user to enter a Fahrenheit temperature. The program 
should read the temperature as a type  double  number and pass it as an argument to 
a user-supplied function called  Temperatures() .
This function should calculate the 
Celsius equivalent and the Kelvin equivalent and display all three temperatures with a 
precision of two places to the right of the decimal. It should identify each value with the 
temperature scale it represents. Here is the formula for converting Fahrenheit to Celsius:  
   Celsius = 5.0 / 9.0 * (Fahrenheit - 32.0)  
The Kelvin scale, commonly used in science, is a scale in which 0 represents absolute 
zero, the lower limit to possible temperatures. Here is the formula for converting Celsius 
to Kelvin:  
   Kelvin = Celsius + 273.16  
The Temperatures() function should use  const to create symbolic representations of 
the three constants that appear in the conversions. The  main() function should use 
a loop to allow the user to enter temperatures repeatedly, stopping when a  q or other 
nonnumeric value is entered. 
Use the fact that  scanf() returns the number of items read, so it will return  1 if it reads a number,
but it wonâ€™t return 1 if the user enters  q . 
The == operator tests for equality, so you can use it to compare the return value of  scanf() with  1 .*/
