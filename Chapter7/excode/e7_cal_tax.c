/*Write a program that requests the hours worked in a week and then prints the gross pay,
the taxes, and the net pay. Assume the following:
    a.Basic pay rate = $10.00/hr
    b.Overtime (in excess of 40 hours) = time and a half
    c.Tax rate: #15% of the first $300 20% of the next $150 25% of the rest
Use  #define constants, and donâ€™t worry if the example does not conform to current
tax law.
