- for 0002 -> you need to create a straight flush + flush vs straight flush + (same straight flush) + straight  with specific high values 
- ##solved: try to confuse the system between available straights and straight flush
- Try searching the forums for both of those cases... There definitely exist sufficient hints to get both. You are on the right track about straight flush... If you're spending many hours, your approach is not right. What are representative cases for straight flush? Sure it should beat basically everything... but what if both hands have straight flush?
- Hint: Two specific straight flushes.
- flush (from a hand that also allows for straight) vs straight flush (low ace): 2,5,8,10,13
- I think 2 is more like: straight flush + flush vs same straight flush + straight

The final thing i found to pass the case 2: 9s 8s 7d 7s 6s 5c 5s; Kd Qs Js 0c 8h 9s 5s
kind of wired?
